\title{QuimP2 Change Log}


\author{by Richard Tyson\\Systems Biology DTC, Warwick University\\r.a.tyson@warwick.ac.uk}


\maketitle

\section{QuimP10b}

\subsection{07-01-2011}

\subsubsection{Fixes}

\begin{itemize}

\item BOA - now checks the scale of the image and utilises it to output all measurements in microns (if the time interval < 0, it is set to 1).

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Known Issues}

\begin{itemize}

\item NONE

\end{itemize}


\section{BOA}

\subsection{BOA Version 3.1.  1-07-2010}

\subsubsection{Fixes}

\begin{itemize}

\item Nodes always drawn white on cell paths
\item Zoom now works with single cells
\item Node pixels size is now scaled according to the size of the image - no more disappearing nodes
\item Paths are now displayed optionally
\item No more 'preview' button.  What was the preview is now saved as the final result.  Hence, BOA is not re-run when clicking 'save'.
\item Re-wrote 'cut loops' function to be faster, and included a method to cut any intersects within the final contour. 
\item BOA output now has labelled columns and comments (preceded by a hash)

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Known Issues}

\begin{itemize}

\item Nodes of interacting chains can eclipse each other when drawing.
\item Interacting chains become warped due to them being frozen during close cell proximity.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{BOA Nest Version 1.0.  15-05-2010}

\subsubsection{Fixes}

\begin{itemize}

\item User can now make several selections and add them to the ROI manager.  All selections will be tracked at once.
\item Multiple chains can now interact to prevent them crossing one another
\item Re-structured drawing of the contours. Now faster and more predictable.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Known Issues}

\begin{itemize}

\item Drawing black nodes on white areas means that white nodes get covered in black if nodes overlap, and so both pixels appear to vanish. Temporary fix->draw all pixels white.
\item zoom functionality no longer works as multiple chains now involved.
\item When imageJ downscales images to draw them to screen nodes can become invisible. Temporary fix-> draw pixels 2x2. Need to set node size to the zoom level of the image.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{BOA + Version 2.1.  28-01-2010}

\subsubsection{Fixes}

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed infinite looping when node resolution equals zero.  Limit is now 1 pixel.
\item Exception stacks now print to the IJ results window when asked to save the cause of a crash.
\item Debugged the zoom functionality
\item Fixed window positioning.  Windows are now sized and positioned according to the screen resolution.
\item Fixed cell selection when using rectangular selection.
\item Fixed drawing of the snake.  Pixels are now drawn black if in white regions.
\item Increased the drawing resolution of the trace during contraction (draws every 10 iterations)
\item Re-written node distance correction for more evenly spaced nodes
\item Fixed a bug that left some nodes hanging after final scaling

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Known Issues}

\begin{itemize}

\item NONE

\end{itemize}

\section{ECMM}

\subsection{07-01-2011}

\subsubsection{Fixes}

\begin{itemize}

\item Now includes a visual output
\item Lowered res of visual output to reduce memory requirements.
\item Fixed a bug with the tracking of node co-ordinates that caused them to leave the range 0-1 (coords were not being reset correctly)

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Known Issues}

\begin{itemize}

\item A large stack can still cause a too much memory to be used for the visual output.

\end{itemize}


\section{ANA}

\subsection{07-01-2011}

\subsubsection{Fixes}

\begin{itemize}

\item Measurements of total fluorescence/area where wrong as imageJ was using a bounding box rather than the specified polygon. Now fixed. 

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Known Issues}

\begin{itemize}

\item NONE

\end{itemize}
