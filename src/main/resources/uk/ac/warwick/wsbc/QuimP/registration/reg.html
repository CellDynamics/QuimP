<h3>Dear user</h3>
We are happy that you downloaded our software. Before you start using it we kindly ask you for registering it. 
This process takes less than minute and it is one time only. The key you will get is connected to email
you provide. Therefore one key can be used across all yours QuimP installations. 
<h3>Why we demand registration?</h3>
QuimP evolves as scientific software since 2002. Tracking of QuimP applications is important for us as scientists
as well as for institutions that support its development.
