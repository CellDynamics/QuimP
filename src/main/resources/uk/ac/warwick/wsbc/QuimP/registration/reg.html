<h3>Dear QuimP user</h3>
Thank you for downloading our software. Before you start using QuimP we kindly ask you to register, which will take less than a minute. 
You will obtain a key by e-mail that is linked to the e-mail address you provide.
 You can use your personal key on different QuimP installations.

													QuimP is free for academic, non-commercial use according to the License Agreement found here:
													<A HREF=http://pilip.lnx.warwick.ac.uk/LICENSE.txt>pilip.lnx.warwick.ac.uk/LICENSE.txt</a>
<h3>Why do I need to register?</h3>
QuimP has been developed as scientific software since 2002. Since 2015 BBSRC are funding QuimP development with the goal of making it available as a community resource.
We would also like to acknowledge support from the Software Sustainability Institute who are helping to build a resource that will be sustainable in future.
													Registration is needed to demonstrate the actual demand for QuimP, and is therefore essential to secure continued funding.
													<p>We most welcome any feedback which will help us to make QuimP better!
