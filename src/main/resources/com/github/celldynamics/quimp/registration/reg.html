<h3>Dear QuimP user</h3>

<h3>Why do I need to register?</h3>
QuimP has been developed as scientific software since 2002. Since 2015 BBSRC are funding QuimP development with the goal of making it available as a community resource.
We would also like to acknowledge support from the Software Sustainability Institute who are helping to build a resource that will be sustainable in future.
													Registration is needed to demonstrate the actual demand for QuimP, and is therefore essential to secure continued funding.
													<p>We most welcome any feedback which will help us to make QuimP better!
