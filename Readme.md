# About

QuimP software, a set of plugins for ImageJ, has been developed by Till Bretschneider and Richard 
Tyson to quantify spatio-temporal patterns of fluorescently labeled proteins in the cortex of moving 
cells.

QuimP was first described in Dormann et al., 2002. For information on the classic version, now 
called QuimP1, please follow this link.

QuimP2 which was developed in collaboration with Leonard Bosgraaf (Bosgraaf et al., 2009) 
introduced a new method to correlate local cortical fluorescence with membrane movement. An 
obsolete QuimP2 installation package can be downloaded here (Unzip the archive and move the contents
of the two folders according to their directory name. The help icon that appears when launching the
QuimP toolbar provides an in depth explanation of how to use the associated plugins and the 
individual parameters). An addon for pseudopod analysis resulted in QuimP3 which however is not 
officially supported by the main QuimP development team (contact Leonard Bosgraaf for help instead).

QuimP3 is currently under have development. It will support user plugins, other segmentation 
algorithms, image pre-processing and many other features.
