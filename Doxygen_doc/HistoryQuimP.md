# About
QuimP software has been developed by Till Bretschneider, Richard Tyson and Piotr Baniukiewicz to quantify spatio-temporal patterns of fluorescently labeled proteins in the cortex of moving cells.
QuimP is free software, but we ask you to register by filling out the form on the download page. Monitoring the demand is essential to apply for continued funding of QuimP. We most welcome any feedback which will help us to make QuimP better. Also, please let us know what you use it for.

# History
## QuimP1
QuimP was first described in [Dormann et al., 2002](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12112136?dopt=Abstract). For information on the classic version, now called QuimP1, please follow [this link](http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/T.Bretschneider/Quimp1/QuimP-guide/QuimP-guide.html).

## QuimP2
QuimP2 which was developed in collaboration with Leonard Bosgraaf [Bosgraaf et al., 2009](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cm.20338/abstract) introduced a new method to correlate local cortical fluorescence with membrane movement. An obsolete QuimP2 installation package can be downloaded [here](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/systemsbiology/staff/bretschneider/quimp/quimp_install__20081128.zip) (Unzip the archive and move the contents of the two folders according to their directory name. The help icon that appears when launching the QuimP toolbar provides an in depth explanation of how to use the associated plugins and the individual parameters). An addon for pseudopod analysis resulted in QuimP3 which however is not officially supported by the main QuimP development team (contact Leonard Bosgraaf for help instead).

## QuimP11
QuimP11b adds compatibility for ImageJ (tested with 1.49a) and MATLAB 2014. It also provides batch processing features, improvements to the segmentation GUI, and added stability for contour mapping (see the included help file for details). Click here to download QuimP11b.

QuimP11 supplants earlier version (QuimP10). It has a completely new semi-automated segmentation interface, a greatly improved boundary tracking method based on Richard Tyson's [ECMM method](http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/mmnp/20105102), muti-channel support, and extended documentation. This version remains backward compatible with QuimP10 output.
